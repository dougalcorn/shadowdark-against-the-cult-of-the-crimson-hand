**Here's the premise:**
*Early this morning, sinister cultists of the Crimson Hand raided the nearby village of Hillshire, capturing several villagers before disappearing into the night.

Sister Inna, a priestess of St. Terragnis who escaped the attack, hopes to enlist the heroes in rescuing her fellow villagers.

If the heroes pursue the cultists, they can easily track them to their lair, a dark temple carved into the side of a mountain.

The cultists are led by Dark Apostle Moloch, a dangerous and charismatic man, who seeks to bolster his forces by “converting” the strong, through sinister mind-controlling magic, and sacrificing the rest to his dark god, Ramlaat the Pillager.

Will our heroes be able to rescue the villagers from their grim fate, or will they, too, fall under Moloch's sinister sway?

There's only one way to find out...*
